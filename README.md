# 🚲 Electric Tricycle Chassis Design & Simulation

This project focuses on the structural design and validation of a custom electric tricycle chassis optimized for safety, manufacturability, and dynamic load handling.

---

## 🛠️ Project Summary

- Designed chassis from scratch in **SolidWorks** for ergonomic and structural efficiency.  
- Performed **ANSYS FEA** simulations to evaluate stress distribution and load stability.  
- Optimized joint placement and material use to reduce weight and increase durability.
